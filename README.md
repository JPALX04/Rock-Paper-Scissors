Rock Paper Scissors

This is the first project that uses JavaScript available in The Odin Project Foundations course. In it, I was able to put my skills acquired during the course into practice by creating a rock, paper, scissors game.
The main objective was to practice the use of EventListeners and DOM manipulation.
